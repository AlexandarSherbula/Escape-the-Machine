# Escape-the-Machine
A top down game where you traverse through room of obstacles and trying to, well....escape the machine.

Originally an entry to the olcCodeJam2020, this game was later on expanded to have more features, such as encore mode, time trials and survival mode for both normal and encore mode.

Greatest of all, it runs on browser.

Many thanks to Moros1138 (https://github.com/Moros1138) for setting up all of the web related stuff, like creating server for leaderboard list, and compiling it to wasm for browser usage.
